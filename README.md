## Features
**This is a project still under development**
-This is a Single Page Application developed using MERN stack.
-This project features 4 main functionalities 
1. Data visualization - user able to visualize performance of DE models toward benchmark function in charts(line/bar)
2. DE Model simulation - user able to simulate DE models by giving parameters (cloud computing by AWS EC2) 
3. Author(me) portfolio - A student portfolio page to appreciate my mentor/supervisor Ts Dr. Lim Seng Poh for his unwavering support 
4. Profile Management - Page for user to manage and modify their profile

## DE Models Compared
The dashboard compares total 80 different Differential Evolution models by combining 10 mutation schemes, 4 crossover operators and 2 selection methods
